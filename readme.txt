Empty mag throw simulation: while reloading a depleted mag (ammo null), A.I and player both, unit will drop an empty magazine on ground. 
Simulation uses relative velocity with randomization and sound effect when hit on ground. 

If reloaded weapon supports proxy magazine tech, mod will get the magazine model accordingly.
If not, it will spawn a generic rifle magazine model.
