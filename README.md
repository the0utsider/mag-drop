Author: cgokmen 'the0utsider'
Description:Empty mag simulation: while reloading a depleted mag (ammo null), A.I or player, unit will drop an empty magazine on ground.
It uses relative velocity, sound effect when hit on ground. Uses a generic magazine model in game since weapon mags' are part of weapon model itself, they can't be used.

Mod use arma3's own physx based particle system so It doesn't kill performance, have almost 0 impact on performance.
